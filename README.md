# WieeRd's Neovim Config

I'm too lazy to use a mouse.

## TODO

### Meta

- 'Light' branch - Minimal config to use over SSH
- Add `README.md` to each directory with descriptions
- Stop ricing linux and focus on actual projects you idiot

### Config

- `custom/keymaps`
	+ Add mapping descriptions
	+ Toggle boolean value (`true` <-> `false`)
	+ 'whole buffer' text object
- `custom/options`
	+ Refactor using a single table and for loop
- `ftplugin/`
	+ `after/ftplugin/`: Real filetypes like `markdown`
	+ `ftplugin/`: Plugin filetypes like `fugitive`

### Plugin

- Snippet: luasnip, neogen
- Active UI: trouble, telescope, explorer, terminal
- Passive UI: statusline, tabline
- Aesthetic: folding, searching
- Code formatting
- Session/Project management
- Debugging: nvim-dap
