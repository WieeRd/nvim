# WieeRd's Neovim Config

I'm too lazy to use a mouse.

## TODO

### Meta

- Move things under `lua/wieerd/` and add `wieerd.setup()`
- Light mode - minimal config to use over SSH
- Add `README.md` to each directory with descriptions
- Keep track of external dependencies and manage it with Nix
- Stop ricing Linux and focus on actual projects you idiot

### Custom

- `custom/keymaps`
  - centralize all keymaps, including plugins'
  - Add mapping descriptions
  - Toggle boolean value (`true` â†” `false`)
- `ftplugin/`
  - `after/ftplugin/`: Real filetypes like `markdown`
  - `ftplugin/`: Plugin filetypes like `fugitive`

### Plugin

- setup `which-key`
- try out `coq_nvim`
- check out `markdown-preview.nvim`
