# ARCHIVED

**My work continues at the new integrated dotfiles repository.**

### [`WieeRd/ricefield`][ricefield]

This archive contains 4 years and 4 iterations/refactorings worth of my
Neovim config development. From the first [`init.vim`] to fully fledged
personalized IDE. Unfortunately, about an year of semi-abandonment left this
config in a chaotic mess, outdated and unorganized. But you (or future myself)
might be able to dig up some useful snippets and ideas from here.

[`init.vim`]: https://github.com/WieeRd/nvim/commit/66323cfa25dcb8c5a0a634cbcbfe63b58fb299f9
